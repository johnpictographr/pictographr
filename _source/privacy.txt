At Piktochart, we believe privacy matters. This document serves to inform and elaborate on our management of information which has been collected from our users and which has been entrusted to us.

User details
Piktochart requires new users to sign in via Facebook, Google+ or with an email address, unique username and password. Only the username can be publicly viewed by others in the Piktochart online output view when published to HTML. We may email our users from time to time (once a month at the most) with updates to keep in touch. Nothing more. We promise not to spam your inbox unnecessarily. Neither do we share or sell our user database to any 3rd party organisations or advertisers.

User infographics
As stipulated on Piktochart’s terms and conditions, Piktochart reserves the right to use infographics made by Free users for marketing and promotion of Piktochart as an infographic making tool. We may request user permission before doing so.

While PRO users have the option of keeping their infographics private, Free users will have all published infographics to be viewable by anyone with the URL. Anyone is also able to re-use, cite with attribution to the original user and link where the infographic (created by a Free user) was found. For more information please refer to this article. Piktochart is able to feature publicly published infographics on its gallery.

Piktochart and Children Under 13
As a family friendly site, Piktochart has a zero tolerance to obscenity and nudity featured in any created infographics hosted on Piktochart. We believe it is the responsibility of schools, libraries and parents to limit the time spent on the internet by children in their care.

In efforts to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Piktochart’s products and services are directed only to people who are at least 13 years of age or older.
