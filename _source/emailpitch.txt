Dear Mr. Rahman,

Congratulations on your new 42M round.  I learned about this news from Techcrunch, and from the Solutions section on your website, I noticed that your company and mine may have some synergies in the content creation area. 

My name is James Ming, a serial entrepreneur in Los Angeles.  I am launching my 5th business this Fall... SocialCampaigner.com ... an enhanced social media posting tool, currently targeting political campaigns.  

This is a shot in the dark and I would be ingratiated and indebted to you for a moment of your time.  I would like to get your feedback on an innovative and completed product offering I want to bring to market.   I am looking for market validation or advice that can steer me on the right track.  Your opinion is greatly appreciated and can save me time and further investment in my resources.


The concept is pretty straight forward.  Visual graphic content gets more noticed than text ones in social media postings, especially facebook news feeds.  I believe these visual graphic posts deserve their own mini-site, ones that can be launched into a new window tab when users click on them. These mini-sites, ( I call 'Social Posters' ), have hotspots that can launch videos, downloads of PDFs, or redirects to other external sites.  Although my initial target for this new product are political campaigns, I believe the concept has value in just about any sector; any digital marketing plan can benefit from this form of enhanced social post. More details of this idea can be found at SocialCampaigner.com. 

Thank you so much in advance for your time.  If you can find a break in your day to give me a call, I'd like to talk further with you and 'pick your brain.'  I hope you would consider my request.



Regards,



James Ming
